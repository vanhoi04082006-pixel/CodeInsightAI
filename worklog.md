# CodeInsight AI — Project Worklog

## Project Overview
**CodeInsight AI** — "Paste a GitHub Repository. AI Understands Everything."

A production-grade, futuristic SaaS web app that analyzes GitHub repositories with AI: cloning, scanning, dependency graphs, security/performance/bug analysis, and an AI CTO chat. Built with Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, React Three Fiber, Framer Motion, Prisma (SQLite), and the z-ai-web-dev-sdk LLM.

---

## Current Project Status: ✅ Fully Functional (v1.0)

The application is complete and verified end-to-end via agent-browser + direct API testing. All core user flows work.

### Completed Features
- **Landing page**: animated 3D AI Core (R3F: distorted icosahedron, particle starfield, bloom, chromatic aberration, mouse parallax), hero with repo URL input, features grid, how-it-works pipeline, testimonials, pricing preview, FAQ accordion, CTA, footer.
- **App shell**: collapsible glass sidebar with nav, sticky topbar with ⌘K command palette, mobile bottom nav, animated neural-network canvas background, sticky footer.
- **Analyze flow**: URL input → 8-stage animated pipeline (Clone, Scan, AST, Dependency Graph, Embeddings, Static Analysis, AI Analysis, Reports) with per-stage progress, live log terminal, active 3D core → completion screen with score grid.
- **Dashboard**: overall health gauge, 5 score cards with deltas, score-breakdown radial chart, language pie chart, complexity trend area chart, commit activity bar chart, frameworks list, top-issues list.
- **Project Report** (8 tabs): Overview (gauge + breakdown + key files), Architecture (pattern, layers, strengths/weaknesses), Bugs, Security, Performance (expandable issue cards with AI recommendations + severity badges), Dependencies (interactive zoom/pan graph with node inspector + circular-dep detection), Docs (generated README + API docs with copy), Roadmap (features + monetization + tech debt).
- **AI Chat**: real LLM integration via z-ai-web-dev-sdk. System prompt positions AI as Staff Engineer / Security Expert / CTO. Builds rich context from the report (scores, files, issues, architecture). Markdown rendering, suggestion chips, typing indicator, persists messages to DB.
- **History**: list of past analyses from DB with mini-scores, language bars, search filter, click to reload.
- **Settings**: account, AI model picker (GPT-4o/Claude/Gemini/DeepSeek), analysis-depth toggles, notifications, theme picker.
- **Pricing**: 3 plans, monthly/yearly toggle, comparison table, enterprise CTA.
- **Design**: glassmorphism, neon cyan/violet/pink accents, animated gradients, grid background, noise, custom scrollbars, framer-motion page transitions + micro-interactions. Dark theme. Responsive (mobile bottom nav).

### Architecture
- Single `/` route (per constraints) with Zustand state-based view switching (landing/dashboard/analyze/project/chat/history/settings/pricing).
- **API routes** (Next.js Route Handlers, Node runtime): `/api/analyze` (POST generate+persist, GET list), `/api/report` (GET full report by id), `/api/chat` (POST → z-ai-web-dev-sdk LLM with repo context, persists messages), `/api/history` (GET list, POST single with messages).
- **Prisma schema**: `Analysis` (scores, metadata, full report JSON, languages/frameworks JSON), `ChatMessage` (role/content, cascade delete).
- **Analysis engine** (`src/lib/analysis-engine.ts`): seeded PRNG (mulberry32) generates deterministic, realistic reports from repo URL. Curated profiles for react/next/vue + generic. Builds scores, languages, frameworks, dependency graph (nodes/edges/circular), issues (bugs/security/performance with severity, file, line, recommendation, effort), files, architecture layers, tech debt, roadmap, monetization, generated docs.
- **3D**: `src/components/3d/ai-core.tsx` — R3F Canvas, distorted icosahedron + inner sphere + 2 torus rings + Sparkles + 600-particle starfield + mouse-parallax camera (lerp) + Bloom + ChromaticAberration postprocessing. `active` prop speeds up animation during analysis.

### Verification Results (agent-browser + curl)
- ✅ Landing renders: hero, 3D core, features, pricing, FAQ all present.
- ✅ Analyze pipeline: 8 stages animate, progress %, live log, completes in ~16s.
- ✅ Completion screen: scores (Overall 84, Security 95, Performance 72, Architecture 91, Maintainability 82, Code Quality 76), file/line counts.
- ✅ Project Report: all 8 tabs render, issue counts, health gauge, tags, summary.
- ✅ AI Chat (LLM via curl): returns detailed senior-level analysis referencing specific files (e.g. "Hardcoded API key in `config/database.ts` line 78", "Unescaped HTML in `src/components/Header.tsx` line 164").
- ✅ History API: persists and returns analyses.
- ✅ No lint errors. No runtime errors in dev log.

### Known Issue / Environment Constraint
- **Dev server persistence**: The sandbox kills background processes (including `setsid`/`nohup`/`disown` watchdogs) between bash tool calls. A `watch-dev.sh` respawn loop is in place; the 15-min cron `webDevReview` job also restarts/verifies. The user-facing Preview Panel is served through the Caddy gateway on port 81 → localhost:3000.

## Unresolved Issues / Risks
1. **Dev server persistence across bash calls** — sandbox reaps processes. Mitigated by watchdog + cron. If preview is blank, run `cd /home/z/my-project && nohup setsid ./watch-dev.sh </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 &`.
2. **Analysis is simulated** — the engine generates deterministic realistic reports rather than actually cloning GitHub repos (sandbox has no outbound git). The LLM chat is real and reasons over the generated report context. A future phase could integrate real GitHub clone+parse if network access is available.
3. **Chat session continuity** — chat is client-side (Zustand) + persisted to DB per analysisId. On reload the in-memory chat clears (DB history loads only via history view, not auto-restored into chat). Could add chat restore on analysis load.

## Priority Recommendations for Next Phase
1. **Real GitHub integration**: use GitHub API to fetch repo metadata (stars, language stats, README) to enrich the report instead of pure simulation.
2. **Chat restore**: load persisted ChatMessages when reopening an analysis from History into the Chat view.
3. **More charts/depth**: add maintainability trend, duplicate-code heatmap, dead-code list.
4. **Export**: wire PDF export (currently Markdown copy + share link toast).
5. **Auth**: wire NextAuth GitHub/Google OAuth (UI exists in Settings; backend not connected).
6. **More views polish**: UML/sequence/database diagrams in Docs tab.
